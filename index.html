						A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks,
						which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a
						 cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp,
						 and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree
						 root hash).

					What it was supposed to solve is a double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network.
					Its goal was to provide a usable high-volume payment system.

					<h2>Bitcoin blockchain vs git</h2>
					<section>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What it stores?</h3>
						git - snapshot of the system in time
						Bitcoin - transactions history
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>How it creates the chain?</h3>
						Both are using cryptography
						Bitcoin additionally uses asymmetrical cryptography for transaction signing
						and leverages a Proof Of Work algorithm
