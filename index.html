						A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks,
						which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a
						 cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp,
						 and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree
						 root hash).

					What it was supposed to solve is a double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network.
					Its goal was to provide a usable high-volume payment system.
